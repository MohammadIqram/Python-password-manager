WELCOME TO PASSWORD MANAGER APPHOW TO USEopen cmd in the current folder and write the following command  pip install -r requirements.txt	ORinstall packages manually 1. pybase64 using command  pip install pybase642. pip install pycryptodomexNonce: A random nonce must be a random and unique value for each time our encryption function is used with the same key. Think of it as a random salt for a cipher. The library supplies us with a secure nonce.Scrypt: Scrypt is used to generate a secure private key from the password. This will make it harder for an attacker to brute-force our encryption.Salt: A new random salt is used for each run of our encryption. This makes it impossible for an attacker to use precomputed hashes in an attempt to crack the cipher. (see rainbow table)Scrypt parameters:N is the cost factor. It must be a power of two, and the higher it is the more secure the key, but the more resources it requires to run.Base64: We encode all of our bytes-type data into base64 a convenient string representationTag : The tag is used to authenticate the data when using AES in GCM mode. This ensures no one can change our data without us knowing about it when we decrypt.
